GISH Importer
=============

A quick hack written in < 20mins to take the list of items at gish.com and turn it into a spreadsheet.

1.) Go cut and paste the source of items.php into a file called items.html
2.) Run this.
3.) It outputs CSV formatted text in a file called "output.csv"

There is a lot that could be done to get this done, but this was a turbo project.
