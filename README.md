GISH Importer
=============

A quick hack written in < 20mins to take the list of items at gish.com and turn it into a spreadsheet.

1.) Go cut and paste the source of items.php into a file called items.html

2.) Run this.

3.) It outputs CSV formatted text in a file called "output.csv"

There is a lot that could be done to get this done, but this was a turbo project to get things imported as quickly as possible.

In 2018 there was some inconsitency in the HTML, which meant the first line was missing from most of the output, and the last line was missing from the description and that needed tidying up manually (but that was easier than fixing this code, especially as we can't expect it to be consistently broken year on year).
